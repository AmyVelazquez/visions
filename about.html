                <br>
                <p>This Intensive is an online workshop unlike any other you’ve ever experienced. We call it an
                    Intensive because, well, it’s intense.

                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Yet, once you hear Jared Spool break these new approaches into bite-sized concepts that are easy to
                    understand, you’ll feel like these ideas make complete sense. That’s because they’re a natural next
                    step to your lived experience.
                    </b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Every moment of every session presents new ideas and explores original ways to approach UX research
                    practice. Past attendees have told us they feel like what they learned has revitalized their
                    careers.
                </p>
                <h3>Your minimum commitment: 8½ hours over six days.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The <b>Fundamentals of Strategic UX Visions</b> package consists of one 60-minute session and five
                    90-minute sessions, each led by Jared Spool. The <b>Prepare to Lead (PTL) a Strategic UX Vision</b>
                    package adds another 60-minute session plus three 90-minute sessions. Altogether, there are fourteen
                    hours of mind-expanding material over the two weeks.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We hold each session twice: at 12pm (16.00 GMT) and 6pm (22.00 GMT). You can attend either session,
                    and Jared will be there to answer your questions.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Plus, each session’s recording is available the next day. That way, if you miss one, you can catch up
                    quickly.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>You’ll have questions. We’re ready for that. Each 90-minute session will give us plenty of time to
                    discuss how you’ll make all this work in your situation.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Discuss the gnarliest of challenges, and you’ll come away with all the assurance you need that you’ve
                    got this.

                <br>
                <p>We offer two packages for this intensive to match where you’re at.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The 8½-hour <b>Fundamentals of Strategic UX Visions</b> package is for emerging and existing UX
                    Leaders who
                    want a solid understanding of what goes into a Strategic UX Vision.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Jared Spool will introduce all the essential concepts behind Crafting and Leading a Strategic UX
                    Vision. You’ll discover how to establish the vision, build up the research, communicate the vision,
                    and get buy-in from stakeholders.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The attendance-limited, 14-hour <b>Prepare to Lead (PTL) a Strategic UX Vision </b> package is for UX
                    leaders ready to make this happen in their organizations. You’ll work directly with Jared Spool to
                    create a leadership plan to craft and roll out your strategic UX vision. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These additional sessions cover the implementation details to start your organization’s
                    transformation. We limit the attendance at the PTL sessions, so you’ll get more of Jared’s time to
                    address your particular challenges.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The PTL package also includes a pre-conference session, during which you’ll share your current
                    challenges with Jared. This way, he can tailor the sessions to your needs and supply you with extra
                    resources to give you additional insights into your transformation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Additionally, as a PTL member, you’ll meet with Jared for a private, 30-minute <b>1-on-1 Mentoring
                        Session</b>, to address any challenges you encounter once you’ve started applying what you’ve
                    learned.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Note: We won’t offer this Intensive publicly again before the end of 2025.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>If you think your organization will need to clarify and define its direction in the next year, you
                    don’t want to miss your opportunity to learn from Jared.</p>

                <h3>Tuesday, June 4: Deliver Better-Designed Products with a Research-Driven Roadmap</h3>
                <p><i>90 minutes at either 12pm or 6pm ET (16.00 or 22.00 GMT).<br><br>

                        The roadmap is the pivotal place to show the value of Strategic UX Research.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All significant strategic decisions originate in your organization’s product roadmap. The roadmap
                    determines the
                    direction of your products and services, which determines your organization's direction. As a UX
                    leader, the roadmap is
                    your opportunity to have the most influence over user experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    Your Strategic UX Research will shape significant product decisions when you anticipate what those
                    decisions will be.
                    The roadmap is your essential fortune-telling device, predicting the future of every team’s work. As
                    a result, your
                    entire organization becomes more knowledgeable about what your users need when you read the roadmap
                    and discern what it
                    subtly is telling you.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Move beyond starting each project from scratch and instead begin with an in-depth knowledge of
                        what your users and
                        customers need.</li>
                    <li>Change your organization’s mindset from “we have to build a thing” to “we have to solve a
                        customer’s problem.”</li>
                    <li>Construct your long-term research agenda from the UX outcomes of each item currently on the
                        roadmap.</li>
                    <li>Add market-leading innovations to the roadmap that come directly from gaps you’ve uncovered in
                        your users’ experiences.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Monday, June 3: Win Influence with a Strategic UX Research Approach</h3>

                <p>It’s frustrating to know that your organization could deliver better user experiences. Everything
                    you’ve
                    tried has failed to make the executive stakeholders understand how UX benefits your organization’s
                    success.</p>

                <p>We start the week on the most important: Expanding your UX research strategy to win critical
                    influence
                    with your executives and your organization. They’ll now see you as a true UX leader.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn your user research into an essential function that stakeholders won’t arbitrarily cut out
                        of
                        every
                        project.</li>

                    <li>Drive organizational success by establishing outcome-driven objectives.</li>

                    <li>Build your stakeholders’ expertise and understanding of your users and customers by increasing
                        their
                        exposure.</li>
                    <li>Expand the UX research maturity of your organization by upgrading your methods and approaches.

                    All significant strategic decisions originate in your organization’s product roadmap. The roadmap

                    <p><b>The Fundamentals of Strategic UX Research</b></p>
                    <p><i>June 3-7, 2024</i><br>
                        <i>90-minute sessions each day</i><br>
                        <i>Choose either 12pm ET (17.00 GMT) or 6pm ET (23.00 GMT)</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>Each day during the week, you’ll attend a 90-minute session containing a new aspect of Strategic
                        UX
                        Research. You can choose the session that is best for your schedule. Jared will be at both to
                        introduce you to the fundamentals and answer your questions.</p>
                    <p>Right now, you might just be “Strategic UX Research curious.” If so, our <b>The Fundamentals of
                            Strategic UX Research</b> package is precisely what you need.</p>

                    <p>In the five daily sessions of the Fundamentals package, Jared Spool will introduce all the
                        essential
                        concepts behind Strategic UX Research. You’ll explore how your research will influence your
                        organization’s priorities
                        and demonstrate your value up the org chart.</p>

                    <p>Instead, you may be ready to start implementing changes. In that case, our <b>Prepare to Lead</b>
                        package is right for you.</p>

                    <p>With the Prepare to Lead (PTL) package, you get all five sessions from the Fundamentals package
                        and
                        an additional three 90-minute sessions the following week.</p>

                    <p>These additional sessions cover the implementation details to start your organization’s
                        transformation. We limit the attendance at the PTL sessions, so you’ll get more of Jared’s time
                        to
                        address your particular challenges.</p>

                    <p>The PTL package also includes a pre-conference session, during which you’ll share your current
                        challenges with Jared. This way, he can tailor the sessions to your needs and supply you with
                        extra
                        resources to give you additional insights into your transformation.</p>

                    <p>Plus, the PTL package includes a 30-minute one-on-one coaching session with Jared that you can
                        use
                        anytime after the Intensive. He’ll work with you to review what you’ve achieved at that point
                        and
                        collaborate with you on
                        how to proceed with your transformation.</p>

                    <p>
                        All significant strategic decisions originate in your organization’s product roadmap. The
                        roadmap
                        determines the
                        direction of your products and services, which determines your organization's direction. As a UX
                        leader, the roadmap is
                        your opportunity to have the most influence over user experiences.</p>
                    <p>
                        Your Strategic UX Research will shape significant product decisions when you anticipate what
                        those
                        decisions will be.
                        The roadmap is your essential fortune-telling device, predicting the future of every team’s
                        work. As
                        a result, your
                        entire organization becomes more knowledgeable about what your users need when you read the
                        roadmap
                        and discern what it
                        subtly is telling you.</p>

                            customers need.</li>
                        <li>Change your organization’s mindset from “we have to build a thing” to “we have to solve a
                            customer’s problem.”</li>
