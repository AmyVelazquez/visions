                    Craft and Lead Your Org‚Äôs Strategic UX Vision
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>Reenergize your career and transform your organization into a lean, mean UX delivery machine.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>That‚Äôs the power of a <b>Strategic UX Vision.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Here‚Äôs why you need it:</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Too many organizations suffer from a lack of direction.</h3>
                <p>There‚Äôs a constant vagueness of what the organization‚Äôs executives want to accomplish in the long
                    run. Sure, there are short-term deadlines to push out new releases, but where is all this work
                    taking them?¬†
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The executives, whom everyone looks to for a definition of the organization's direction, are too
                    focused on increasing their numbers. The charts need to go up and to the right. Yet, they‚Äôre not
                    focused on how that increase will improve customers' lives.¬†
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Organizations are running without a plan. The good news is that this lack of direction from senior
                    stakeholders is an opportunity for UX leaders like you.¬†
                </p>
                <h3>Reinvigorate your organization with a Strategic UX Vision.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Everyone in the organization is looking for someone to provide clarity and definition. You can be
                    that person. You can fill in the void left by the lack of direction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>You will do that with a <i>Strategic UX Vision.</i> Your vision will add detail and definition to the
                    vague statements and missions, asking the all-important question: <i>‚ÄúHow will our best work lead to
                        better lives for our customers, users, and even our colleagues?‚Äù</i>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>When you craft and promote your vision, you‚Äôll infuse meaning into your organization‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs no
                    longer about moving business numbers up and to the right. Your work will now be about concrete
                    improvements to the lives of customers and users.
                </p>
                <h3>Increase the UX team‚Äôs contribution, influence, and value.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Your experience vision will win you influence across your organization. You‚Äôll use that influence to
                    win over your executives and senior stakeholders to become strong champions for better-designed
                    products and services.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As an emerging UX leader, you‚Äôll use your vision to influence the product roadmap and define your
                    organization‚Äôs direction. You‚Äôll use your newly refined persuasive storytelling skills to offer a
                    clear, human-centered plan for how your organization will improve people‚Äôs lives.¬†</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>You‚Äôll make work meaningful again for you, your team, and everyone involved in building great
                        products.</b> Your Strategic UX Vision will clarify how better UX benefits the organization and
                    why it‚Äôs
                    an essential path to success.</p>

                <p>I learned that the vision needs to focus on the future experience, not necessarily the specific
                    screens/product, and effective storytelling will be the most crucial part of successfully convincing
                    others that your vision (out of potentially many) is the one to back.</p>

                <p>Your organization can‚Äôt achieve any of these goals without appealing to your customers' and users'
                    needs and desires. The products and services you offer must significantly improve the customers‚Äô and
                    users‚Äô lives. Your organization has to deliver improvements so significant that your customers will
                    pay handsomely for the immense value they‚Äôll receive.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>A Strategic UX Vision clearly shows your entire organization how your products and services will
                    improve the lives of your customers and users. It serves as a flag in the sand that everyone can
                    see.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Because every team can see that UX vision flag from where they sit today, you can declare a single
                    directive: March toward the flag. Everyone now knows the direction they need to go. And because your
                    future vision is compelling to everyone, it will inspire them to make it happen.

                <p>In our October Intensive, we‚Äôll walk you through the proven process for crafting a Strategic UX
                    Vision that will capture the imagination of your entire organization. You‚Äôll get the techniques and

                <p>Your organization can‚Äôt achieve any of these goals without appealing to your customers' and users'
                    needs and desires. The products and services you offer must significantly improve the customers‚Äô and
                    users‚Äô lives. Your organization has to deliver improvements so significant that your customers will
                    pay handsomely for the immense value they‚Äôll receive.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>A Strategic UX Vision clearly shows your entire organization how your products and services will
                    improve the lives of your customers and users. It serves as a flag in the sand that everyone can
                    see.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Because every team can see that UX vision flag from where they sit today, you can declare a single
                    directive: March toward the flag. Everyone now knows the direction they need to go. And because your
                    future vision is compelling to everyone, it will inspire them to make it happen.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In our October Intensive, we‚Äôll walk you through the proven process for crafting a Strategic UX
                    Vision that will capture the imagination of your entire organization. You‚Äôll get the techniques and
                    practices for keeping everyone focused on achieving that vision.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>With a Strategic UX Vision, you‚Äôll demonstrate how better UX can achieve your organization's desired
                    success while giving you a strong leadership voice in shaping the organization's direction.
